Tweet Writer Prediction Model
This project involves building a machine learning model that can predict the writer of a tweet based on its content. The dataset contains tweets from five different individuals, and the model is trained to classify each tweet into one of the five categories.

Dataset
The dataset contains tweets from five different persons. Each tweet is labeled with the name of the writer. The dataset is used to train a classification model to predict the writer of a given tweet.

Data Format
The dataset is in CSV format with the following columns:

Tweet: The content of the tweet.
Person: The name of the person who wrote the tweet.

Installation
To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
nltk
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Model Training
The model is built using scikit-learn, and you can train it using the following steps:

Load the dataset by running the script model.py.
Preprocess the tweets by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and applying other text preprocessing techniques.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machine).
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Usage
To predict the writer of a tweet, use the trained model and input the tweet text. Here's an example of how to use the trained model:

python
Copy
Edit
from model import predict_writer

tweet = "This is an example tweet."
predicted_writer = predict_writer(tweet)
print(f"The predicted writer is: {predicted_writer}")
Evaluation
The model is evaluated based on accuracy and other classification metrics. Results can be found in the script model.py.
